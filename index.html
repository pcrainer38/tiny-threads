                <br/>
                To all who so generously contributed to the “tiny” project of creating preemie smocks for babies in our local hospital’s NICU: Your kindness has made a tremendous impact. For many parents, these will be their baby's first outfit, and your contributions have added immense joy and comfort. <br/>
                <br/>
                The rich colors and soft flannel fabric will be a source of visual delight and sensory comfort for both the staff and parents. These garments will provide warm hugs to the babies and exemplify the care and compassion of our community.<br/>
                <br/>
                Your support—whether through monetary donations, equipment (like the extra sewing machine), time, or other means—has been invaluable. A special thank you for helping make this dream come true for my daughter, a dedicated NICU nurse. Your generosity has brought a touch of magic and comfort to her patients and their families.<br/>
                <br/>
                With heartfelt gratitude, <br/>
                <br/>
